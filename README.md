### Hi there, I'm Hajara ðŸ‘‹

A full stack software developer.

ðŸ˜„ About me...

I studied architecture at uni, where I learnt to solve problems and put together spaces that are usable, functional and (most importantly) aesthically appealling. 

When the pandemic came around, my education was suddenly disrupted and I began to think about the everyday technologies that we all found ourselves increasingly dependent on. I started teaching myself to code and soon afterwards discovered the School of Code's 16 week immersive Bootcamp program.

I enrolled in Nov 2021 and have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of discovering the wonder that is coding. I'm excited for what the future holds as I continue on this journey.
